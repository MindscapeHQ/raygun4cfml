Valid To Dos as of December 5, 2009

- Debug output should be more descriptive and readable, Raw debug data available
  via verbose flag.
  
- Normalize arguments. Should be able to reasonably define a method with or
  without named arguments, and invoke it as named or positional. See
  how the engines do it.

- add invocation record for both pattern and literal that were executed. This
  should allow verification of either. 
 
- mock should record all invocations and store literal parameters
- verifying by pattern should also be possible
  e.g., 
   register:
       mock.foo(1,2).returns();
       mock.foo(4,5).return();
   actual exec:
       mock.foo(1,2);
       mock.foo(1,2);
       mock.foo(4,5);
       
   verify:
       mock.verifyTimes(3).foo('{numeric}','{numeric}');
   
   And vice versa:
      mock..foo('{numeric}','{numeric}').returns();
   
   actual exec:
        mock.foo(1,2);
        mock.foo(1,2);
        mock.foo(4,5);

    verify:
        mock.verifyTimes(2).foo(1,2);
        mock.verifyTimes(1).foo(4,5);
   
- DONE -verbose . maybe should persist actual literal arguments in addition to hash
