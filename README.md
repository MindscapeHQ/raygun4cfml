## How to contribute

The main repository of this project is https://github.com/MindscapeHQ/raygun4cfml. Please fork from there, create a local develop branch and merge changes back to your local master branch to submit a pull request. Even better, get in touch with me on Twitter (@AgentK) or here on Github before you undertake any work so that it can be coordinated with what I'm doing.

Most of the active development happens in my own fork: https://github.com/TheRealAgentK/raygun4cfml - feel free to peek around in there.
