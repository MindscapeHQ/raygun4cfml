WHAT
*************
These tests are designed to showcase the mxunit plugin. 
Many of them fail or error in order to demonstrate that behavior. 
One of them, InvalidMarkupTest.cfc, is a bad file and as such 
will generate an eclipse Error prompt when you load the component. 
This is expected and designed to show you what happens when 
you try to run a test that contains invalid CFML.

*************
INSTALLING THE PLUGIN
*************
In Eclipse:

1) Help -- Software Updates -- Find and Install
2) Select the "Search for new features" radio button. Click Next
3) click the "New Remote Site" button. Add the url "http://mxunit.org/update". give it any name.
4) Click through. It'll download the plugin and install it. It will prompt you to restart eclipse.
