Overview:
Used best for running groups of tests, test suites, and directories of
tests. Writes test results in XML, JUnitXML, or HTML to a specified
location. This is particularly useful for generating JUnit style
reports, using Ant's <junitreport ...> task.

This handles BASIC as well as NTML authentication as well as SSL.

This assumes a basic knowledge of Ant.

Dependencies: This assumes you have Ant installed. If not, please
download the latest version from http://ant.apache.org/.

The stylesheets in this package are the same as those in JUnit. Just a
few slight modifications/branding were made.

Usage: See sample-build.xml for usage.
